# Build a Rails App with a Angular Front End

## Overview

In this app you'll be making a Single Page Angular App

## Requirements

### Angular

1. Must use an Angular Front-End that includes at least **5 pages**
2. Must contain some sort of nested views
3. Must contain some sort of searching as well as filtering based on some criteria. Ex: All items in the "fruit" category, or all tasks past due
4. Must contain at least one page that allows for dynamic updating of a single field of a resource. Ex: Allow changing of quantity in a shopping cart
5. Links should work correctly. Ex: Clicking on a product in a list, should take you to the show page for that product
6. Data should be validated in Angular before submission
7. Must talk to the Rails backend using `$http` and Services. **you may not use $resource**

### Rails

1. Backend created with JSON that accepts and stores the data for Angular

## Instructions
1. Create a new repository on GitHub for your Angular Application.
2. When you create the Angular app for your assessment, add the spec.md file from this repo to the root directory of the project, commit it to Git and push it up to GitHub.
3. Submit that repo to the assessment immediately.
4. Build your app there. Make sure to commit early and commit often. Commit messages should be meaningful (clearly describe what you're doing in the commit) and accurate (there should be nothing in the commit that doesn't match the description in the commit message). Good rule of thumb is to commit every 3-7 mins of actual coding time. Most of your commits should have under 15 lines of code and a 2 line commit is perfectly acceptable. **This is important and you'll be graded on this**.
5. Make sure to check each box in your spec.md (replace the space between the square braces with an x) and explain next to each one how you've met the requirement *before* you submit your project.
5. Record at least a 30 min coding session. During the session, either think out loud or not. It's up to you. You don't need to submit it, but we may ask for it at a later time.
6. Submit a video of how a user would interact with your working web app.
7. Submit the url to your github project
8. Write a blog post about the project and process.

Unlike the rest of the curriculum, if you have any questions about your assessment or need help with it, please *donâ€™t* use the Ask New Question feature. Rather than working with Learn Experts, please reach out to the Learn Instructor responsible for this section instead - Luke / luke@flatironschool.com / learn-co slack: luke.

## If you're a Learn-Verified Premium student:

We should reach out to you soon to schedule a review. If you don't hear from us in 48 hours after submission, reach out to us on Slack!

### Be Prepared to:

1. Explain your code from execution point to exit point. We're making sure you wrote it and understand how it works, nothing else. 5-10 minutes
2. Write tests together. You'll be responsible for making tests pass, not writing test code. However, you'll be expected to provide expected return data of methods. You'll need to know how your code should work, not rspec or testing. 20-30 minutes
3. Refactor code. 20-30 minutes
4. Extend the application with a new feature, more data, a different domain etc. 20-30 minutes
5. Submit an improved version.
6. Write a README.md.

### What to expect from the instructor review

We have two goals for the instructor review. The first is to make sure that you understand, can talk about and can add to your code in real time - we want to make sure that you've really learned the material in this section. The second goal is to prepare you for technical/coding interviews when you graduate.

Your instructor wants you to succeed, but starting at the Rails portfolio project and on the portfolio projects after it, they're going to quite deliberately give you a bit of a harder time and be less obviously supportive during the portfolio project reviews so you get a better sense of the kind of experience and pressure that you might get when taking a technical interview. Unlike some technical interviewers, we really do want you to succeed, and we'll work with you as many times as necessary to get you through the review if you don't nail it the first time (which is quite common and completely OK). However, we will potentially give you a hard time, cut you off, push you on your use of vocabulary and/or your coding choices. We want to try to give you a sense of what a coding interview might be like, so you build the confidence to describe your app and to write code even in a higher pressure, slightly more adversarial environment.

Given this, don't be surprised if the instructor doesn't necessarily take the time to "teach" you anything you get wrong. As a rule of thumb, if the instructor has to teach you something, you didn't pass the project review! However, if you feel there was anything you didn't understand or would like to discuss, let the instructor know at the end of the session and they can suggest another instructor who will be able to pair with you on that to help you with your understanding before you retake the project review.
